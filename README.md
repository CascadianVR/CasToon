# CasToon
 A Unity shader I'm making for use with my 3D avatars I create.
 The main purpose is to have consistant lighting in various lighting conditions in games like VRChat as well as to have all of the features and options I desire.
 I have no clue what I'm doing so feel free to tell me what's wrong.
